✅What is the average weekly sale price per store?;

✅ Which attribute has the highest modifier (positive or negative) with the number of sales? (And that makes sense);

✅ From the store with the highest accumulated revenue (sum of sales for the entire period), how many weeks of the year did it exceed the average for the period?;

✅ Make a graph with the maximum, minimum and average sales of all stores over time. Highlight in some way the vacation period mentioned above;

✅ Thinking about expanding one of the stores, which store would you choose and why?;

✅ For each of the stores that have the highest coefficient (with the highest growth trend)
